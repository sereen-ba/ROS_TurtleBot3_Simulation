# ROS_TurtleBot3_Simulation
________________
TurtleBot3 is a small, affordable, programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research, hobby, and product prototyping. 
The goal of TurtleBot3 is to dramatically reduce the size of the platform and lower the price without sacrificing its functionality and quality while also offering expandability. 

The TurtleBot3 can be customized into various ways depending on how you reconstruct the mechanical parts and use optional parts such as the computer and sensor [1]. 

TurtleBot3 supports a development environment that can be programmed and developed with a virtual robot in the simulation.
There are two development environments: Fake Node and Gazebo.

The fake node is used for testing a model of TurtleBot3 and movement of the robot, but it does not support using sensor data so that SLAM and Navigation are not supported in it.

On the other hand, Gazebo allows Turtlebot3 to use virtual sensor data in the simulator: IMU, LDS, and camera information simulating TurtleBot3 with SLAM or Navigation.
